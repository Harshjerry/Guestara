3.shifting montsh feature 

4. adding description title and label color to events with a pop-up

5. Everything build from scratch  without using any library


To run app locally 
 fork the repo and after reaching the folder calen in your terminal   
 install all the packages using npm i  command 
 and run development ser using commmand (npm run dev)

 it will be run on LOCAL HOST 5173


Further 
 I followed the ViteJS guide to set up the framework and built the project from scratch without using any libraries. I have almost added all functionality, including updating, deletion, event handling, today and month slider functions, and highlighting today.
Learnings
From this assignment, I learned to use DayJS, deep context API, and how to handle complex states. 
Difficult
The most difficult part was managing events for a particular day and updating them.



If given more time, I would have designed a  new interface and added drag functionality as well.
